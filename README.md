# 🌍 Global Health Expenditure Analysis: Clustering Trends & Spending Patterns

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **global health expenditure trends** across **100+ countries**, leveraging **Power BI, Python, and Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)** to uncover patterns in **healthcare spending efficiency**. The analysis identifies **regional disparities, government vs. private healthcare funding, and trends over time** to drive actionable insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Power BI** (Desktop & Service)  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
- **Power Query & M Language**  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, PyCaret)**  
- **K-Means Clustering (Machine Learning)**  
- **Data Visualization (Bubble Maps, Scatter Plots, Correlation Heatmaps)**  
- **Cloud Integration (OneDrive, SharePoint, Power BI Service)**

## 📊 Key Insights & Findings
### **1️⃣ Cluster-Based Classification**
- **Segmented countries** into **4 clusters** based on healthcare expenditure efficiency.
- Identified countries with **high efficiency (high spending, better outcomes)** vs. **low efficiency (low spending, poor outcomes)**.

### **2️⃣ Geographic & Financial Trends**
- **Europe & North America:** High **government-funded** healthcare spending.  
- **Africa & South Asia:** Low **government funding**, higher reliance on **private sources**.  
- **Higher GDP per capita** correlates with **higher health expenditure per capita**.

### **3️⃣ Time-Based Trends**
- **Government healthcare spending** has increased in high-income countries but remains stagnant in developing nations.  
- **Private sector funding** is rising in middle-income countries.
